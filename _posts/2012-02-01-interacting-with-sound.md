I gave a short talk at Interaction ’12, explaining how sound gives us a whole other channel of interaction to take advantage of. There are many opportunities to use sound as a mechanism for user feedback – opportunities we often taken for granted when designing for primarily visual mediums.

Designing an experience that walks the line between *silent* and *intrusive* can be difficult, but designing for sound can help us embed our work with emotion, provide actionable information, and reinforce user behavior.
