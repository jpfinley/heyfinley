  <p>I was assigned to create a non-traditional storybook as a final project in my high school creative writing class. The book needed to be constructed in a way that spoke to its content in an atypical fashion.</p>
  <p>I chose to write about my experience working as a server in a suburban banquet hall. I presented my collection of short stories and photographs in the form of a toque blanche, the starched white hat worn by chefs.</p>
  <p>The stories are printed out and adhered together to create a single stream of text. The reader spins the cardboard tube along the central axis to view the next page. When the story is over, all of the paper is rolled back up again.</p>
