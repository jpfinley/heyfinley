The Story Drifter is a tool that allows a person or a group of people to
construct a non-linear narrative based on the context of an event and its
connections with surrounding information. Our proposed tool uses stories,
photos, videos, historical artifacts, names, dates, and anything else that
could help to illustrate not only what happened, but why it happened.

The Story Drifter helps build a non-sequential narrative through images,
words, video and sound to provide context for the audience to begin making
connections about the topics presented to them. It encourages the audience to
ask why an event happened, instead of simply asking them to memorize a set of
facts about a particular event.

The Story Drifter fits into the classroom experience by allowing educators to
comprehensively and intuitively teach about a topic on the fly. It can be used
to present a planned lesson and can adapt to answer students' questions as
they come up.

In addition to a large-scale, touch screen application, the software for the
Story Drifter can be adapted for small-scale use on a computer screen. This
will allow more individuals to use the Drifter as a tool for exploration since
they won't be limited to expensive, space-consuming equipment.

Story Drifter was a group project with [Clint Beharry][22] and [Katie Koch][23].
