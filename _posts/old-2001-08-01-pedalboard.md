  <p>The Pedal Board was created as a way to organize and simplify the way I practiced guitar. I was tired of constantly breaking down the equipment when I was done practicing, and frequently changing batteries was becoming expensive.</p>
  <p>Aside from functioning as a physical base on which I can easily arrange and transport my effect pedals, the board also houses a power supply which I designed and built. This provides electricity to each of the pedals, eliminating the need for batteries. Additional outlets accommodate power adaptors and external lighting (for when I am rocking on a dark stage).</p>
