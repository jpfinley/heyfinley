Iâ€™m often asked what things a person should be reading if they are just starting out in UX. The answer is going to be different no matter who you talk to, but what follows are a few resources that informed a lot of my design upbringing.

## Fundamental Design

- *[Elements of Typographical Style](http://amzn.com/0881791326)*. Jason Santa Maria once made meread this book in three days. I think I'm a better person for it.
- *[Understanding Comics](http://amzn.com/006097625X)*, Scott McCloud. Makes you consciously consider things you may have known all your life on only a subconscious level. One of those books that expands your mind.
- *[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://amzn.com/0961392142)*, Edward Tufte. Tufte is nearly a genre into himself, and I think this volume is his best, especially for outsiders.
- *[Interaction of Color](http://amzn.com/0300179359)*, Josef Albers. Albers' deep understanding of how color's relativity manifests itself is valuable for designers of all kinds.

## Interaction Design & User Experience

- *[Designing for Interaction](http://amzn.com/0321643399)*, Dan Saffer. A great survey of principled interactions for a variety of inerfaces and context. Maybe start here.
- *[About Face](http://amzn.com/1118766571)*, Alan Cooper. When you're done with Saffer, dive into this.
- *[Designing Interfaces](http://amzn.com/0596008031)*, Jenifer Tidwell. The edition I have is full of interfaces whose visual design is now outdated, but whose principles remain relevant.
- *[Designing Interactions](http://amzn.com/0262134748)*, Bill Moggridge. Really interesting oral histories from pioneers from many industries.
- *[The Design of Everyday Things]()*, Donald Norman. Posted here for fear of losing all professional credibility.
- *[Infinite Jest](http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loeqm22IxF1qmlqceo1_250.gif)*, David Foster Wallace. I mean, have you read it?

## News & Blogs

- [Designer News](https://news.layervault.com). A Hacker News clone that, while hit or miss, can help one pick up on emerging trends and products.
- [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com). A consistent source of best practices and thought-provoking process. The best pieces here usually regard meta-design  and user experience strategy.
- [Little Big Details](http://littlebigdetails.com). Proof that small things can have an impact. This site its kind of like Doritos for your mind.

## Other Resources

- [The Interaction Design Association](http://ixda.org). In their own words: "a member-supported organization dedicated to the discipline of interaction design." This is the group responsible for the annual [Interaction confrerence](http://ixda.org/page/interaction).
- Graduate programs. While not necessary and not for everyone, a number of graduate programs exist for those looking for a structured UX education. Not all are focused on the same aspects of user expereince and each have relative strengths and weaknessess.
