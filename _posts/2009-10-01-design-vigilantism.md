As part of a project in Jason Santa Maria's [Communicating Design][23] course,
we were assigned to emulate [Cardon Webb's technique][24] of removing street
fliers and replacing them with interpreted redesigns.

I chose to replace a notice found in the lobby of my own apartment building,
urging tenants to keep the hallways clear and to prevent fire hazards.

I redesigned the notice by taking inspiration from the building itself: taller
than it is wide, a strong brick fa&ccedil;ade, and steel fire escapes bolted to
narrow windows. The choice of H. Berthold AG's Akzidenz-Grotesk was made based
on typefaces that would have existed when the apartment was built in 1927.

Akzidenz has a history dating back to the 1900s, shortly before the apartment
building was constructed. And like my apartment, Akzidenz has received many
additions and alterations in its long history. Specific variants that I used
emulate the tall & narrow shapes I found in the building's windows, as well as
providing a strong foundation to the flyer's appearance.

Yellow is used throughout to not only help identify the document as a warning,
but to break up the mass of black text with some amount of ornamentation.
