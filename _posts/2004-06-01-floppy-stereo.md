### June 2004

Floppy Stereo was an attempt to create a personal music jukebox. It is
constructed out of a salvaged computer, LCD display, USB number pad, and
multiple floppy diskettes.

Many years ago I began to convert my music collection from compact disk to
compressed audio files. This afforded me the portability and convenience that
come with audio files, but I felt the experience was missing something.
Previously, I would select a jewel box from my collection, open it up, insert
the disk, and play it. With everything on a hard drive, playing the same track
was reduced to a few clicks.

I missed the selection, the album art, and the dusty trays and hand-written
CD-Rs. The absence of the compact disk reminded of another format that had
recently gone away: the 3.5" floppy diskette.

The Floppy Stereo attempts to recreate that ceremony within a single device.
An album's playlist file is stored on a floppy disk, complete with the album
art. When it is loaded, the playlist is read and retrieves the songs from my
MP3 collection. Pushbutton controls are wired to a USB keypad. The
[software][23] I wrote listens for the specific key-presses and sends the
message to the playback software.

The result adds an aural, tactile, and considered interaction to an otherwise
neglected experience.
