        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>I am interested in full-time and freelance positions that challenge me as an interaction designer.

Other interests include public spaces &amp; exhibit design, live music, urbanism, and physical computing.</p>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <h4 class="job-title">Interaction Designer, The Barbarian Group</h4>
      <h5 class="job-location">New York City, New York. August 2011 - Present.</h5>
      <p>At The Barbarian Group, I work within a cross-country team of producers, developers, content strategists, and graphic designers to create emotional experiences for our clients. I am responsible for tasks as varied as information architecture, user research, and interface design. I participate in design critiques and presentations of my work to clients.</p>
      <h4 class="job-title">Interaction Designer, Centro</h4>
      <h5 class="job-location">Chicago, Illinois (and later, New York City). October 2008 - June 2011.</h5>
      <p>Though I came to Centro as a software engineer, I soon developed an interest in interaction design. Eventually I shifted to the Product Development team so I could focus on developing an interaction design framework that would fit our agile work style for our flagship application, Transis. Since then, I have put in place methods and schedules which allow me to perform research, strategy, and conceptual design for multiple web applications used internally and externally. As an interaction design team of one, tight collaboration with developers makes it possible for me to see my ideas take shape.</p>
      <h4 class="job-title">Software Engineer, Centro</h4>
      <h5 class="job-location">Chicago, Illinois. June 2007 - October 2008.</h5>
      <p>I developed a variety of web applications to manage the digital media buying process, collectively known as Transis. At Centro, we blend practices of interaction design into an agile software development environment (mixing Scrum and XP). Some of my duties involved estimating features for development, pair programming, debating product vision, and giving technical presentations to my coworkers. I've helped develop four applications that help people do things such as manage advertising campaigns, perform quality assurance on banner ads, and collaborate on purchase orders among groups.</p>
